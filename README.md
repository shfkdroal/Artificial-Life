# Artificial-Life

I only left the part that I have done. 

In main.cpp loop, I mainly contribute to 'attack' part since I took charge of AI and Core cell part.

For the rest of part, I designed and write the entire codes. 


Cell.h : Super class for all kind of cell. It contains common features among cells. 
Core.h : Core cell of all cells that serve as calculator of all operations : Attatchment, Destroy for tree structures, etc
Enemy.h: Enemy cells that mainly contrains decision making AI built on HMM
